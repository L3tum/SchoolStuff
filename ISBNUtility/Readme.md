# ISBNUtility

### Features

This project aims to provide easy-to-use functions for performing various operations on ISBN.

Mainly these are:

* Recognize the ISBN version
* Convert from ISBN-10 to ISBN-13 and vice-versa
* Hyphenate an unbroken ISBN
* FInd various informations in the [openlibrary.org](http://openlibrary.org) Database

By default the hyphenator will first attempt to download the up-to-date version of ISBN-Ranges from [isbn-international.org](https://www.isbn-international.org) but also includes a usually up-to-date version of these ranges, precompiled into JSON.
The last update to these ranges was on 01.10.2018.
